# RedditScraper
Program that uses Prawl and Pandas to scrape information from Reddit.

The program currently outputs the top 10 subreddits mentioned in r/All and correlates that information with the number of
exclamation points found in any title associated with that subreddit. The program is currently set at a limit of 1,000 posts.
